# Overview

This repo does a few things. For one it is a website. Not a great one yet, 
but it is still one. You can view the website at jscray.art Nothing works there yet.

For two, it scrapes american sign language gestures from handspeak.com. It stores these 
gestures in csv files making them accessible to others. 

For three it uses these gestures and with our gestures recognition model engine, it is able to compare our transcribed gestures to real time feeds from the camera.

We use python and or javascript to run our model to compare to our dictionary of gestures.

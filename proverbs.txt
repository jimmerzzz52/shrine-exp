There is no ACCOUNTING for tastes
It is impossible to explain why different people like different things (especially things that

Quot. 1897 links the form more days, more dollars to sailors being paid by the day: the longer

quantity of by-forms.

If ANYTHING can go wrong, it will
Commonly known as Murphy’s Law, this saying has numerous variations, and the concept
was certainly known much earlier in engineering or scientific circles: e.g., 1878 Minutes
Proceedings of Institute of Civil Engineers li. 8 (13 Nov. 1877 session) It is found that
anything that can go wrong at sea generally does go wrong sooner or later. The formulation as
a ‘law’ is said to have been made in 1949 by George Nichols, then a project manager working
in California for the American firm of Northrop, developing a remark made by a colleague,
Captain E. Murphy, of the Wright Field Aircraft Laboratory. The contexts of some early
quotations appear to support this origin: e.g., 1955 Aviation Mechanics Bulletin May-June 11
Murphy’s Law: If an aircraft part can be installed incorrectly, someone will install it that way.
1953 A. ROE Making of Scientist 46 There is.. the physicist who introduced me to
one of my favorite ‘laws’, which he described as ‘Murphy’s law or the fourth law of
thermodynamics’ (actually there were only three the last I heard) which states: ‘If
anything can go wrong it will.’ 1956 Scientific American Apr. 166 Dr. Schaefer’s
observation confirms this department’s sad experience that editors as well as laboratory
workers are subject to Murphy’s Laws, to wit: 1. If something can go wrong it will, [etc.].

ART is long and life is short
Hippocrates (Aphorisms I. I.
life is short, but art is long)
compared the difficulties encountered in learning the art of medicine or healing with the
shortness of human life. Hippocrates’ saying was alluded to by Seneca in his dialogue ‘On the
Brevity of Life’ (De brevitate vitae I: vitam brevem esse, longam artem) and from this version
the usual Latin form of the tag is derived: ars longa, vita brevis, art is long, life is short. Art is
now commonly understood in the proverb in a less specific sense. In quot. 1958, it refers to
(the durability of) a work of art.

ATTACK is the best form of defence
The idea of the pre-emptive strike expressed in a form approaching this appears to be
American in origin; cf. 1775 W. H. DRAYTON in R. W. Gibbes Documentary Hist. American

WASHINGTON Writings (1940) XXXVII. 250 Make them believe, that offensive operations,

BAD money drives out good
Commonly known as Gresham’s Law, after Sir Thomas Gresham (c 1519–79), founder of
the Royal Exchange. Gresham saw the economic need to restore the purity of the coinage,
though there is no evidence that he actually used this expression. Quot. 1902 states that the
principle, not the proverb, is mentioned in Gresham’s letter to the Queen. (1858 H. D.
MACLEOD Elements of Political Economy 477 He [Gresham] was the first to perceive that a
bad and debased currency is the cause of the disappearance of the good money.)

Thomas Gresham’s letter to Q. Elizabeth in 1558, that ‘bad money drives out good’. 1933

The BIGGER they are, the harder they fall
Commonly attributed to the boxer Robert Fitzsimmons, prior to a fight c 1900 (see quot.

the 4th-cent. AD Latin poet Claudian (In Rufinum I. 22 Tolluntur in altum Ut lapsu graviore
ruant, men are raised on high in order that they may fall more heavily).
1902 National Police Gazette 27 Sept. 6 ‘If I can get close enough,’ he
[Fitzsimmons] once said, ‘I’ll guarantee to stop almost anybody. The bigger the man, the
heavier the fall.’ 1927 ‘C. BOYER’ Mosaic Earring i. ‘I haven’t seen.. even an imitation

Candlemas day be cloudy with rain, winter is gone, and won’t come again
In the Church calendar, the feast of the Purification of the Virgin Mary and the
Presentation of Christ in the Temple falls on 2 February, which is known as Candlemas Day
because candles are blessed at church services on that festival. In North America, 2 February
is popularly known as Groundhog Day; the very similar weather prediction associated with it
arises through the notion that if the groundhog emerges from its burrow on that day into bright
sunlight and is frightened by its own shadow it will go back for a further six weeks’
hibernation. The superstition was known from at least as early as the early sixteenth century:
cf. 1523 SKELTON Works I. 418 Men were wonte for to discerne By candlemas day what
wedder shulde holde. Quot. 1584’s version of the rhyme is close to the Latin lines in quot.

CANDLEMAS day, put beans in the clay; put candles and candle-sticks away
For Candlemas Day see preceding proverb. The two halves of the proverb appear to have
come together comparatively recently, with the instruction about sowing beans possibly being
displaced from St Valentine’s day (14 Feb.) in response to the shift from the Old Style to the
New Style calendar; cf. the rhyme attested from c 1640 On Saint Valentine’s Day cast beans in
clay But on Saint Chad (2 Mar.) sow good or bad (John Smyth, Berkeley MSS 33. no. 89).

minister by Louis XVI in 1783: si c’est possible, c’est fait; impossible? cela se fera, if a thing
is possible, consider it done; the impossible? that will be done (quoted in J. Michelet Histoire

The expression is frequently found in various metaphorical and allusive forms, such as to

FALL down seven times, get up eight
Japanese proverb
1997 New York Times 24 Aug. (online) ‘I always told him, “Fall down seven times,

morning that showed him falling down on the basketball court numerous times. Seven
times to be exact. Toward the end of the commercial, it shows him lying face down on the

like ‘Fall down seven times. Get up eight.’ It seems very motivational. perseverance

The FAMILY that prays together stays together
The saying was invented by Al Scalpone, a professional commercial-writer, and was used
as the slogan of the Roman Catholic Family Rosary Crusade by Father Patrick Peyton (P.
Peyton, All for Her, 1967). The crusade began in 1942 and the slogan was apparently first
broadcast on 6 Mar. 1947 during the radio programme Family Theater of the Air. The Crusade
in Britain started in 1952, and the expression now has many (often humorous) variant forms.
1948 St. Joseph Mag. (Oregon) Apr. 3 ‘More things are wrought by prayer than this
world dreams of’, and ‘The family that prays together stays together.’ Such religious
themes are hardly what one would expect to hear propounded over the air waves of our

Where MACGREGOR sits is the head of the table

SELL in May and go away
A saying relating originally to the cycle of activity on the London Stock Exchange. May,
shortly after the start of the financial year, was a busy time, but during the following months a
bear market prevailed as trading was slack and Londoners (stockbrokers included) enjoyed
their summer breaks away from the capital. Also current in the expanded version represented
by quot. 2002, referring to the classic St. Leger horse race run at Doncaster in early
September, the traditional end of the English summer social calendar.

Do not spoil the SHIP for a ha’porth of tar
Ship is a dialectal pronunciation of sheep, and the original literal sense of the proverb was
‘do not allow sheep to die for the lack of a trifling amount of tar’, tar being used to protect
sores and wounds on sheep from flies. Hog (quots. 1623 and 1670) seems to have been
understood by Ray (quot. 1670 note) as a swine, but it was also a widely used dialect term for
a young sheep older than a lamb but before its first shearing. The current form of this proverb
was standard by the mid nineteenth century. The metaphorical phrase to spoil the ship for a
ha’porth of tar is also found.

hog, for a halfeperth [halfpennyworth] of tarre. 1631 J. SMITH Advertisements for

In this form, from a remark made by Napoleon to the Polish ambassador De Pradt (D. G.
De Pradt Histoire de l’Ambassade.. (1815) 215), following the retreat from Moscow in 1812:
Du sublime au ridicule il n’y a qu’un pas, there is only one step from the sublime to the
ridiculous. The idea, however, was not original to Napoleon: 1795 T. PAINE Age of Reason II.

The short poem Try (try) again was often quoted in nineteenth-century children’s

Hickson, who quoted it (with three try’s) in his Moral Songs (1857) p. 8, but Palmer’s use is
earlier. The saying was soon used independently as a proverb.

Never give a SUCKER an even break
This saying has been attributed to various people, including E. F. Albee and W. C. Fields.
It was popularized by Fields, who is said to have used it in the musical comedy Poppy (1923),
though it does not occur in the libretto. Poppy was made into a silent film in 1925 and called
Sally of the Sawdust. This was in turn remade as a ‘talkie’ in 1936 (see quot. 1936). The
proverb means that one should not allow a fair chance to a fool, or one who may be easily
deceived.

true, wasn’t it?’ ‘Which line?’ I asked. ‘Never give a sucker an even break’ he [W. C.

There is a problem in the logic of detection of movements.
If the first pose of a gesture with movement matches a pose of a gesture without movement, the recognition will fail.
If this isn't a problem, i.e., the first pose of any gesture with movement isn't the same of a static gesture, then 
we could rely os just identifying the first gesture and all would work. Since ASL contains gestures with movement that
can't be the case.

This seem to indicate that to identify gestures with movement we would have to send to the gesture recognizer class
all the frames in the past T seconds and then apply the steps:
    1 - If there isn't a movement in the past T seconds, recognize static gestures;
    2 - All check points of all possible gestures with movement would have to be measured;
    3 - The recognized gesture would be the one were all the checkpoints were recognized in the incoming video
        and also where the acumulated error is the smallest.

# NOTE: It's possible to create a buffer of arrays using collections.deque, each frame is appended efficiently 
at the beggining of the queue and every frame that has its time larger than T should be dropped. Is this efficient?
I can walk the array and consecutively drop frames that have its time larger than T, seems efficient...
